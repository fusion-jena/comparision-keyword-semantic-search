This repository provides the code for a Java application to expand a given search term on semantically related concepts.
It supports the expansion on synonyms, descendant and ancestor nodes.
The system takes a list of search terms as input and generates a csv file as output with related terms from ontologies. 

The csv structure also contains the kind of expansion (synonym, child, parent), e.g.,

* "ontology";"uri";"sourceTerm";"expansionTerm";"synonym";"childNode";"siblingNode";"parentNode"

Two terminology services are currently supported:

* GFBio TS: https://terminologies.gfbio.org (all available ontologies)
* Bioportal: https://data.bioontology.org (limited to [OBO Foundry ontologies](https://obofoundry.org/) GO and CMO)


## Prerequisites

The code has been implemented and tested with Java 1.8., Apache ANT 1.10 and ivy need to be installed, too.

For Bioportal an access key is needed: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/accounts/new

##Installation

* open a command line and navigate to the folder

```
ant run

```
